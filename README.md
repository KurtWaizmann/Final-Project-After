# After.
https://jointheafter.life/

Built in July 2022 by [Kurt Waizmann](https://github.com/kurt-waizmann) as a personal project for the Concordia Web-Development Bootcamp. “After” is an experiment in contextual storytelling for a fictional corporation and service. The aim was to build a website inspired aesthetically by corporate websites, while interweaving bits of creative writing. The idea being that users could piece together a narrative from their explorations of the website. Designed in _Figma_, then built in _React_. Includes various forms of animation, a user database, an API, original video and writing.
